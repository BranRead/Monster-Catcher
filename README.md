# Monster-Catcher
No idea what to call this. As of right now, I have no plans to make this an actual proper game. More a test of what I can do using the canvas element with HTML.  
It started as a project I made following a tutorial found here:  
[Pok√©mon JavaScript Game Tutorial with HTML Canvas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP5DKzriqXA&t=7135s)  
I've extended the project quite a bit.  
Here's the features I added:
- A battle menu with ability to use items, attack, befriend and flee
- Recruit monsters
- Additional monsters
- Enter the player's house and room
- Completely new tileset for world
- Talk to an npc who heals you
- Pick up three different items
- Items on overworld as well as hidden
- Basic inventory management
- Basic team management
- Save the game
### Things to do:
- [x] Fixed paths to assets
- [ ] Clean up code and add comments explaining functions 
- [ ] Actual level ups (EXP can be gained but doesn't do anything)
- [ ] Create better stats for monsters and in turn related items
- [ ] Create interior maps for the other two houses
- [ ] New sprites for NPCs and more of them
- [ ] Movement for NPCs
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Complete the options for team in the menu
- [ ] \(Optional) New sprite for player
